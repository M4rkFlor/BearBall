How to make a non player object in a networking program

Use the basse that you have created in Alan and Ryan's tutorials for this one

Creating the Spawner
	1)Download and run the program given, make sure the networking works and the player can move around
	2)Create an empty gameobject called PowerUpSpawner

Creating the Prefab
	1)Create a cube in the hierarchy and call it PowerUp
	2)Click on the cube and add components:
		-Network>Network Identity
		-Network>Network Transform
		-Physics>RigidBody
	3)On the RigidBody component turn off the "Use Gravity" checkbox and turn on the "Is Kinematic" checkbox
	4)Still on PowerUp go into the box collider component and check the "Is Trigger" box


Scripts:
Power Up Spawner Script
	1)Create a new C# script and call it SpawnPowerUp(Make sure it is the same as shown otherwise you may run
	  into errors)
	2)Open the script in a compiler of your choosing
	3)Copy this code over the entire script:

	using UnityEngine;
	using System.Collections;
	using UnityEngine.Networking;

	public class SpawnPowerUp : NetworkBehaviour {
		public GameObject powerupPrefab;
		float time;
		// Use this for initialization
		void Start () {
		
		}
	
		// Update is called once per frame
		void Update () {
			time += Time.deltaTime;
			if (time > 3.0f) {
				Cmdspawn ();
				time = 0;
			}
		}
		[Command]
		void Cmdspawn (){
			Vector3 position = new Vector3 (Random.Range (-Camera.main.orthographicSize, Camera.main.orthographicSize),  Random.Range (-Camera.main.orthographicSize, Camera.main.orthographicSize),0);
			GameObject powerup = (GameObject)Instantiate (powerupPrefab, (position), Quaternion.identity);
			NetworkServer.Spawn (powerup);

		}
	}

	4)Build and Save the script then attach it to the PowerUpSpawner

Power Up Script
	1)Create a new C# script and call it PowerUp(Make sure it is the same as shown otherwise you may run
	  into errors)
	2)Open the script in a compiler of your choosing
	3)Copy this code over the entire script:

	using System.Collections;
	using System.Collections.Generic;
	using UnityEngine;

	public class PowerUp : MonoBehaviour {

		// Use this for initialization
		void Start () {
		
		}
	
		// Update is called once per frame
		void Update () {
		
		}
		void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) {
			if (other.gameObject.tag == "Player") {
				print ("you picked up a powerup");
				}
				Destroy (gameObject);
			}

		}
	}
	4)Build and Save the script then attach it to the PowerUp in the hierarchy

Final Steps
	1)Drag the PowerUp into the assets of the project to make it a PreFab
	2)Click on the Power Up Spawner
	3)On the Spawn Power Up Script drag the prefab for the PowerUp into the empty transform 
	4)Delete the old cube in the hierarchy
	5)Under the NetworkManager, add the PowerUp Prefab as one of the registered Network prefabs under Spawn info.
